#### How to create game account/change password?

Using telegram [bot](https://t.me/openrohelperbot) send `account` and follow instructions. Syntax is very simple `account <desidred-name> <password-to-account> <sex M or F>` for example command `account xxbbxb passw0rd M` will create male account. To change password send `account <your-existing-account-name> <new-password>`.

#### I don't remember my account name, where can I get it?

send `accounts` and bot will tell you accounts you have.

#### What will happen if I remove your bot from my telegram?

Nothing, you are free to delete bot whenever your want.
